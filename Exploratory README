# Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL. The primary objectives are to:

- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- Perform statistical analyses to summarize the data.
- Identify trends and patterns within the data.
- Examine relationships between different variables.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about layoffs across various companies, including fields like:

- Company Name
- Industry
- Total Layoffs
- Date
- Country
- Stage

## Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

## EDA Steps

Key SQL operations performed include:

- **Data Exploration**: Using queries to identify missing values and duplicates.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Calculating mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
- **Trend Analysis**: Observing patterns over time or across categories.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between variables using correlation coefficients.

## Results

*(Provide a summary of the insights gained from the EDA.)*

## Learnings

Through this project, I have:

- Enhanced my SQL skills in data exploration and analysis.
- Gained experience in preparing datasets for further analysis.

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

- Visualizing the data using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
- Performing predictive analytics to forecast future trends.
